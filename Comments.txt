Great job! Comment your code for clarity.

You can also use concatenation operator between String and numbers, such as ("total is "+5).

Your average is incorrect. You used integer division rather than double division.
double avg = (double) sum / 5;
or
double avg = sum / 5.0;

Avoid doing computation as you print. Compute first and store the result in a variable, then print the result variable.

Use the program behavior defined in the instruction. Ask the user to enter five integers on the same line.
